# Academic Writing & Interview Skills

> 2019-08-14

#### Introduction

The lecture delivered by Dr. Geraint Story was about how to improve our academic writing and interview skills.

#### Reflection

I learned how to write a proper academic article and my interview skill has been improved I think.

#### Discussion

I found that we should focus more on what can we provide for the Company than what we can get.

#### Conclusion & Application

I will use what I had learned from the lecture in my English articles. It is a huge improvement for me.
