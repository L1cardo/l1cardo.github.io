#### Discussion

Because of the two different type of diabetes, we need to treat them differently, but the most effective treatment is not from the medicine, but from ourselves. We need to control our diet in order to control body weight, take less sugar, exercise more.

There are too many people in China that have diabetes, and even more people have pre-diabetes. Diabetes is a silent killer, do not let it take anyone’s life.
