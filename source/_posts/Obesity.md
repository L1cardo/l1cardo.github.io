# Obesity

> 2019-08-17

#### Introduction

The lecture was about obesity and what obesity can cause to human body.

#### Reflection

I have learn the mechanism of getting obese. It is not only just taking too much fat, but taking everything too much. Protein and sugar can also turn into fat and be stored by human body. That is why we can obese even if we take little fat.

#### Discussion

We get obese if our body wants to get obese, no matter how we control our meals. It is somehow written in our genes. So I am wondering if we can control obesity in the genetic level.

#### Conclusion & Application

Although getting obese or not is genetic matter, we need to do our best to control our body. Have a balance diet, do more exercise!
